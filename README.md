### Update
 - To update and get the latest versions, you can run `./uninstall.sh` without deleting the volumes and run `./setup.sh` again. It will prompt you if you want to delete the volumes.

 - You can add modules to the `setup.sh` file by scrolling to the "install_mod" section and add the entries you'd like. Or you could do it manually by putting the modules folders into the `azerothcore-wotlk/modules` folder. `setup.sh` will automatically add the sql. See

 - Running `setup.sh` will not install anything over again unless you delete a modules folder or the `azerothcore-wotlk` folder before. You can run it if you only want to install new modules youve added, it will skip if you already downloaded the repos. 

- If you delete modules, remember to run `clear_custom_sql.sh` first and remove the respective tables in the db.

## AzerothCore Bot Installation
1. Run Setup sh Script:
	```cmd
	./setup.sh
	```

2. choose if you want to install modules besides the given one.
 - (Optional) You can edit `setup.sh` to add another modules
 
3. Wait for docker to install the images.

4. If no error then attach to ac-worldserver by running this command:
	```cmd
	docker attach ac-worldserver
